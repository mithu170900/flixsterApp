### Notes
- I faced some challenges in pushing new codes to the existing repository for Flixster app part 1. A TA helped and we agreed to create a new repository for part 1 and 2. 
- On the contributors section, you might see there are two contributors, including me. My account was connected to someone else's GitHub account by accident. I confirm that I worked on this project on my own.
